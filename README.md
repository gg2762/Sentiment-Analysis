# Sentiment-Analysis
In this study, I am trying to investigate political polarization and identify whether there is a substantial party 
line difference amongst politicians’ twitter presence and their stance towards controversial topics that are known to 
divide the American public. In order to do so, I analyzed roughly 84,000 tweets from political representatives. 
First, I built a classification model to see if it’s possible to predict a Tweet’s party affiliation solely based on 
content and then performed a sentiment analysis to identify representatives’ sentiment regarding a variety of topics. 
The findings from this study show the possibility that growing political polarization stems from factors other than ideology, 
and can lead to delays and roadblocks in the legislative process.
